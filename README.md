This repository contains the source files for the Kerpen Rainwater Management Web App, a tool designed to help homeowners explore sustainable rainwater and stormwater management measures tailored to Kerpen's local climate and urban conditions.

## Purpose
The web app supports residents in:
- Understanding local climate risks (extreme rainfall, drought, rising groundwater)
- Exploring green, engineered, and hybrid rainwater management solutions
- Viewing imperviousness and related spatial data through interactive maps
- Providing property-specific inputs to receive tailored recommendations

## Pages Included
- **Home** – Introduction to Kerpen’s climate challenges and the purpose of the tool  
- **About** – Background of the project and methodological basis  
- **Solutions** – Sustainable rainwater management strategies  
- **Interactive Map** – Visualization of impervious surfaces (more layers coming soon)  
- **User Input** – Form to collect homeowner data for personalized guidance  

## Technology
This site is built using:
- GitHub Pages  
- Jekyll  
- HTML/CSS/Markdown for page structure  
- JavaScript libraries for interactive map rendering  

## Status
This is an ongoing research and development project. Additional map layers, solution details, and user-driven improvements will be added over time.
