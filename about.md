# About This Project

This web app is part of ongoing efforts to support climate adaptation in Kerpen by empowering homeowners with accessible, property level water management guidance.
The project brings together local climate projections, urban hydrology insights, and a wide spectrum of sustainable measures from Nature-based Solutions to engineered and hybrid systems.

**Goal:**  
To provide clear, actionable information that helps residents reduce flooding risks, manage drought periods, improve groundwater recharge, and contribute to greener, healthier neighborhoods.
As climate data and community feedback grow, the platform will continuously expand with new tools and updated recommendations.

**What you'll find here:**
- Practical recommendations for rainwater reuse, infiltration, and flood protection
- Maps showing which solutions fit different locations and soils
- Easy steps for implementing solutions on your own property
